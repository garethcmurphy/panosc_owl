# OWL Ontology for PaNOSC Project 🌌📚  

This repository provides an **OWL ontology** designed for the **PaNOSC (Photon and Neutron Open Science Cloud)** project. The ontology supports photon and neutron science data management for the **European Spallation Source (ESS)** and other participating institutes.

---

## Features ✨  

- **Comprehensive Ontology**: Structured knowledge representation for photon and neutron science.  
- **FAIR Data**: Promotes Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable principles.  
- **PaNOSC Integration**: Aligns with data requirements for ESS and other PaNOSC institutes.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- OWL-compatible ontology tools (e.g., Protégé).  
- Knowledge of RDF, OWL, or SPARQL for querying.  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/panosc-ontology.git  
   cd panosc-ontology  

2. Open the `.owl` file in an ontology editor like Protégé.  

---

## Usage 🔧  

1. Load the ontology into an OWL editor for viewing and editing.  
2. Use SPARQL queries to interact with the ontology.  
3. Integrate the ontology with PaNOSC applications or services.  

---

## File Structure 📂  

- `ontology.owl`: The OWL ontology file.  
- `examples/`: SPARQL query examples for interacting with the ontology.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.
